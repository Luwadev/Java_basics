/*(Science: wind-chill temperature) How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is 
not enough to provide the answer. Other factors including wind speed, relative hu
midity, and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside. In 2001, 
the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature 
to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed. The formula is
 twc = 35.74 + 0.6215ta- 35.75v0.16 + 0.4275tav0.16
 where ta is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit, v is the speed 
measured in miles per hour, and twc is the wind-chill temperature. The formula cannot 
be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58째F or above 41째F.
 Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58째F 
and 41째F and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 then displays the wind-chill 
temperature. */
